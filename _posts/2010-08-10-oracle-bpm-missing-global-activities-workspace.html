Using JMS with Oracle BPM can lead to quirky behaviour. For instance, if the Applications box in the Workspace is suddenly avoid of Global Activities, a possible cause for this is strangely enough the JMS configuration of your BPM process.

I have seen this happen even when none of the Global Activities listed in Applications have anything to do with JMS, but rather initiate a process through screenflows or files on disk. After a restart, the activities were no longer listed in BPM Workspace. In that case check the Log Viewer for similar errors:
<blockquote>Fuego.connector.ConnectorException: Connector [JMSConfigurationMS2Queue1:null:JMS] caused an exception when getting a resource of type [5].

Detail:Connector [JMSConfigurationMS2Queue1:null:JMS] caused an exception when getting a resource of type [5].</blockquote>
Check the External Resources in the Process Administrator or in Studio to verify the JMS servers. After restarting the Applications should return in the BPM Workspace.
