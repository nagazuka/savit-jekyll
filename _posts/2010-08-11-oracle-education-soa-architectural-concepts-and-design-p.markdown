About a month ago I had an opportunity to follow a course delivered by [Oracle University](http://education.oracle.com). I have experience in building with Oracle SOA products, such as BPEL, Service Bus and BPM, but I wanted to know more about the SOA methodology that Oracle envisions. Therefore I chose the course [SOA: Architectural Concepts and Design Principles](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/show_desc.redirect?dc=D70926GC10).

### My thoughts about this course:

#### Pros:
* The course is excellent for learning design principles for SOA, but (big surprise) is only actually useful if you intend to use Oracle SOA software, or rather ex-BEA SOA software.
* I appreciated the fact that the course emphasizes a lot on organizational changes for implementing SOA, which is typically one of the biggest hindrance in SOA implementations in my experience.
* This was the first time I followed an Oracle course at home via the Live Virtual Class format. It was great to avoid traffic jams while travelling to the Oracle office in the Netherlands, but rather sit on my couch and watch the slides on my flatscreen, while directly communicating with the instructor through a headset. I doubt this would have worked so good for more technical (read: hands-on) course.


#### Cons:
* It is originally a BEA course, which is not a problem in itself, since BEA always had a better view and better products on SOA theory than Oracle. But it is a problem if the course material is not updated at all since 2008, the year that BEA was acquired by Oracle.
* There are far too much references to old BEA product names, such as ALSB, ALDSP end ALER. The slides contain a lot of details to these former products, which is not something I expected and appreciated in a SOA theoretical course.

#### Conclusion

To conclude, the course was useful for me, because I am currently using a lot of the ex-BEA products such as ALSB and this course is clearly had those products in mind in its architectural vision. But otherwise I would not recommend it, since it is far too outdated.
